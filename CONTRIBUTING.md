# Contributing

Contributions and feedback on your experience of using this software are welcome.

This includes bug reports, feature requests, ideas, pull requests and examples of how you have used this software.

Please see the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow any templates configured in GitHub when reporting bugs, requesting enhancements or contributing code.

Please note that as I maintain a number of packages it's not always possible to respond to feedback as quickly as I'd like. It can sometimes take a while to get around to reviewing pull requests and acting on issues and feedback, but the time and effort that does into raising them is appreciated.
