# Contributing

Contributions and feedback on your experience of using this software are welcome.

Please see the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow any templates configured in GitHub when reporting bugs, requesting enhancements or contributing code.

##Â Pull Requests

* The latest changes are always in `master` 
* Pull Requests should be raised for larger changes
* Pull Requests do not need approval before merging for those with contributor access (it's just helpful to have them to track changes)
* Rebasing in Pull Requests is prefered to keep a clean commit history (see below)
* Running `npm run lint:fix` before committing can make resolving conflicts easier, but is not required
* Merge commits (and pushing merge commits to `master`) are disabled in this repo
* Pushing directly to master should ideally be reserved for minor updates / one off fixes

## Rebasing

If you create a branch and there are conflicting updates in the `master` branch, you can resolve them by rebasing from a check out of your branch:

    git fetch
    git rebase origin/master

If there are any conflicts, you can resolve them and stage the files, then run:

    git rebase --continue

*If there are a lot of changes you may be prompted to step more than once.*

When the rebase is complete (i.e. there are no more conflicts) you should push your changes to your branch before doing anyhing else:

   git push --force-with-lease

You should see that any conflicts in your PR are now resolved. You can review changes to make sure it contains changes you intended to make.

*If you accidentally sync before pushing, it will trigger a merge. Uou can use `git merge --abort` to undo the merge.*

You can use `npm run lint:fix` to automatically apply Standard JS rules to resolve formatting differences (tabs vs spaces, line endings, etc).
